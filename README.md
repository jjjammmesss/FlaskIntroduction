Hopefully this small project will help with a project you are creating! Below is a quick guide to help you get set up and get this running.

## Dependencies
To get main.py to run you must:
 - Have the latest version of **Python** installed.
 - Use `pip install flask` to install the **Flask** library for Python.
 - Navigate to the project folder in *cmd* and use `python main.py` to run the webserver.
 - This should work!
